# Bristol
A simple pop-up drawing program that appears on key-press and copies straight to the clipboard

## TODO:
* customisable key-bindings

## key bindings:
* `Win+Shift+D` (while window is hidden): show window
* `Return`: copy to clipboard and hide window
* `Esc`: cancel drawing and hide window
* `Alt+F4`: quit
* `Shift+Esc`: quit
* `Tab`: hold to hide colour picker
* `Ctrl+Z`: undo
* `Ctrl+Y`: redo
* `J` and `K`: same as mouse scroll wheel (useful with a drawing tablet)

##  other controls:
* scroll mouse wheel over canvas to resize brush
* scroll mouse wheel over colour picker to change the hue
* drag bottom right of colour picker to resize
